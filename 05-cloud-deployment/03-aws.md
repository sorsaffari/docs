## Run Grakn
Once the deployment is complete, a Grakn Cluster starts automatically. There is no need for starting Grakn Servers manually.

<div class="note">
[Important]
Once deployed, it takes some time for the cluster to fully bootup and synchronise. Allow approximately **two minutes per cluster node**. To check the status of the cluster bootup, you can perform a [cluster health check](#cluster-health-check).
</div>

## Default Credentials
As part of the deployment, AWS produces the default password with username being `grakn`. The screenshots below walk you through spotting the generated password. we need these credentials to access the Graql and Grakn consoles.

[footer:start]The password for username `grakn` is the value of the `GraknUserPassword`.[footer:end]
[slide:end]

</div>

We strongly encourage changing the default password. To do this, we need to first [access Grakn Console](#accessing-grakn-console) and then [update the user](../06-management/02-users.md#update-a-user) `grakn` giving it a new secured password.

## Scale the Cluster
Grakn cluster is deployed within an Auto Scaling Group which allows us to adjust the number of instances in the cluster in a straight-forward manner.
Auto Scaling Groups group together EC2 instances that share similar characteristics and are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of instance scaling and management.

[body:start]![Modify Desired Capacity](../images/cloud-deployment/aws_cf_auto_scaling_edit_b.png)[body:end]
[footer:start]We can now change the values of _Desired Capacity_ as well as _min_ and _max_. For more information, refer to [AWS Documentation on Auto Scaling Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html).[footer:end]
[slide:end]

</div>

## Stop a Grakn Instance
By design, it is not possible to stop an instance belonging to an Auto Scaling Group. When a Scaling Policy triggers the removal of an instance, Auto Scaling always terminates the instance.
As a result, a different procedure is needed for stopping instances.

<div class="note">
[Important]
Before we proceed, we must make sure that the minimum capacity of the Auto Scaling Group that the instance belongs to, is smaller than the current instance count. For instance, if we have three instances running, in order to stop one, the minimum capacity must be at most two. Otherwise, new instances are created in place of the stopped instance.
</div>

### 1. Install the AWS Command Line Interface
Follow the instructions here (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to install the AWS CLI. Upon installation run `aws configure` via terminal.

### 2. Detach the instance from the Auto Scaling Group
```
aws autoscaling detach-instances --instance-ids &lt;id-of-the-instance-to-be-detached&gt; --region &lt;region-name&gt;" --auto-scaling-group-name &lt;name-of-the-auto-scaling-group-that-the-instance-belongs-to&gt; --should-decrement-desired-capacity
```

### 3. Stop the detached instance
```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids &lt;id-of-the-detached-instanced-to-be-stopped&gt;
```

## Restart a Grakn Instance

Having [installed and configured the AWS CLI](#install-the-aws-command-line-interface), we need to first start the instance and then attach it to the right Auto Scaling Group.

### 1. Start the instance
```
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids &lt;id-of-the-instance-to-be-restarted&gt;
```

### 3. Attach the instance to the Auto Scaling Group
```
aws autoscaling attach-instances --instance-ids &lt;id-of-the-instance-to-be-stopped&gt; --region "&lt;region-name&gt;" --auto-scaling-group-name &lt;name-of-the-auto-scaling-group-that-the-instance-belongs-to&gt;
```

## Run Grakn
Once the deployment is complete, Grakn starts automatically. There is no need for starting Grakn Servers manually.

## Default Credentials
When deploying an AMI, the default password is the instance id with username being `grakn`.

[tab:end]
</div>

## Log into a node
For a more direct interaction with the database, we need to log into one of the cluster nodes. To do so, we need to run the `ssh` as shown below.

```
ssh -i <path to the private key> ubuntu@<grakn instance DNS name or IP address>
```

The private key in question is the one that was specified as the `KeyPairName` stack parameter.

We can retrieve the DNS name or IP address by navigating to list of EC2 instances on AWS as illustrated below.
![Grakn EC2 Instances](../images/cloud-deployment/aws_instance_dns_ip.png)


## Cluster Health Check
While [logged into a node](#logging-into-a-node), run `grakn cluster status`. This outputs the list of all nodes, as shown below, with the first column indicating the Status (**U**p/**D**own) and State (**N**ormal/**L**eaving/**J**oining/**M**oving).

![Cluster Health Check](../images/cloud-deployment/aws_cluster_health_check.png)

## Access Grakn Console
While [logged into a node](#logging-into-a-node), run `grakn console start`. This requires us to enter our credentials. If this is our first login, we need to enter the [default credentials](#default-credentials). Once authenticated, we are in the Grakn Console where, for instance, we may manage [authentication](../06-management/02-users.md).

## Access Graql Console
While [logged into a node](#logging-into-a-node), we can enter the [Grakn Console](../02-running-grakn/02-console.md) where we can interact with and perform [queries](../10-query/00-overview.md) on our [keyspaces](../06-management/01-keyspace.md).

## Configuring Grakn
To ensure Grakn behaves according to your specific needs, you may [configure Grakn](../02-running-grakn/03-configuration.md). One important attribute in Grakn configuration file, is the [path to the data directory](../02-running-grakn/03-configuration.md#where-data-is-stored).

## Best Practices
Amazon Web Services offers a wide range of compute options. What follows is a set of generic recommendations for an optimal choice.

### Compute options
The optimum machine choice offering a good balance between CPU and memory should be equipped with at least 4 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM.
Using machines with additional RAM above a 25 GB threshold is not expected to yield significant performance improvements.
Having these bounds in mind, the following machines are recommended because they offer a balanced set of system resources for a range of workloads:
- General Purpose:
    - t2.xlarge,
    - t2.2xlarge,
- Memory Optimised:
    - m5.xlarge,
    - m4.xlarge,
    - m3.xlarge,
- Compute Optimised:
    - c5.xlarge,
    - c5.2xlarge,
    - c4.xlarge,
    - c4.2xlarge,
    - c3.xlarge,
    - c3.2xlarge,
